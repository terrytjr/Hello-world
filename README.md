# Hello-world
First repository

Hi, everyone

I guess github says to wirte something about yourself here.

This is a normal college student majoring in CS. I am now feeling so unsure about the future like all young people do.
I hope to find something attracting in the field of IT, cuz i am feeling guilty right now playing games all day long. I am a junior in college yet still not good at programming,or studying anything I am afraid. I guess its never too late to start.

Like most people studying CS, I would like to go to top company like Google. I decide github is my starting point or at least one of the pass to my goal. I am not a good learner plus I am new to github. Also I know this is not facebook, but i would like to meet and know about other people and learn more about computer science here. Its better of course to make some real practically staff with github. Look forward to everything.

I dont even know if anyone is going to see this but thank you.
